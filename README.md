# :scream: Scary Strings! :scream:
Flag potentially dangerous API calls in PHP code, a.k.a. lines containing **_scary strings_** from a security perspective!

Use this tool as a first step during a security audit on your web applciation's source code!

Flagged lines of code are printed in a tab-delimited format and can thus be easily imported into a spreadsheet!

The list of potentially dangerous API calls comes from the [Web Application Hacker's Handbook](http://mdsec.net/wahh/)!
