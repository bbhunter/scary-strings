# Slop Squatting wordlists
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting

The entries here don't mean that a package is bad necessarily, but that
it is not preferable. This might be because there's a more official,
modern, or well-maintained version of the package that is probably
a safer default.

The wordlists here can be used to help with supply-chains security,
e.g. with a linter like depguard (https://golangci-lint.run/docs/linters/configuration/#depguard)
